A Better Way

If you follow agricultural news, US commodity farmers facing significant financial issues is not a surprise. Throughout 2025, commodity prices have fallen while input prices have continued to rise, and commodities have been at the center of global trade wars. 

Much of the recent press coverage been that “farmers are in trouble,” often with a “man bites dog” tone, focusing on the negative impacts of the Trump administration’s actions on the farmers who supported him, or on the administration’s response, or finger pointing on who is to blame, depending on the news outlet. 

The situation on the ground is far more complex. While commodity farms may be in the same storm, they are not all in the same boat. There are significant differences in farmers’ situations even within the same commodity, driven by regional markets, scales of production and level of debt farmers are carrying. But what I and my colleagues are seeing is the most significant threat to farm viability since the farm crisis of the 1980s.

We have been through farm financial crises before, and we know how they go. This one is different. This one is dangerous, and the ramifications of this and the next few seasons on the structure of agriculture will be fundamental and permanent. We are fortunate that doing the right thing at this moment to prevent significant farm loss is also the most promising path in our lifetime toward achieving long term goals of agricultural equity, regeneration and resilience, and starting the process of healing the deep divide in our country.

This proposal is for a four-year initiative that provides a pathway to a fundamental restructuring of core safety net programs to keep farms in business and incentivize rather than prevent resilient, democratic and regenerative agriculture, starting with the simple idea that one more farm lost is one too many.

**Providing assistance to farmers in financial crisis is the right thing to do.** The significant human cost of farm financial crises is well documented. Farm families under significant financial stress face increased rates of divorce, poor school performance by children, and the likely loss of their home. For individuals facing severe farm financial issues, the frustration and stress will potentially turn inward as depression, self-medication and increased potential for self-harm, or will turn outward in the form of increased violence, aggression or radicalization. Farm financial crises continue to be a very significant recruiting ground for radical extremist groups and are associated with several of the most significant acts of domestic terrorism in US history. These human costs alone are reason for decisive action.

At this moment, the challenges facing farm families are often overwhelmed by the impacts of the current administration’s actions targeting low-wealth, immigrant and non-White communities. Farm families generally have net worth, wealth and income levels higher than the national median, and the commodity farmers at the center of this moment have often gained from federal programs that excluded many other types of farmers. While short sighted, it is understandable for there to be a deaf ear in some corners to the current farm situation, and many organizations will appropriately focus their efforts and limited resources on more at-risk communities. 

But we ignore the situation at our peril. 

At root is the question of who owns farmland. We are at a tipping point where the Jeffersonian ideal of farmer-owned land is giving way to neo-feudalism—with all but the smallest farms owned by either investment vehicles or a very small number of very large farming enterprises. While it has been over 50 years since then USDA Secretary Earl Butz coined the phrase “get big or get out,” we are now seeing the logical fruition of the policy framework behind it. 

In the world of food systems, All vegetables for sale represent approximately 4.3 million acres of farmland. But corn, soybeans and cotton alone represent 175 million acres. 

The model of assistance that the current administration has signalled is likely to increase farm losses over the next few years by providing the biggest checks to the farms that are the biggest, and most able to use their economies of scale and greater assets to lessen losses on the front end and better weather any losses on the back end. The crisis is among those on the smaller end of commodity production \- the family-scale commodity farmers. This includes the beginning farmers, many of the few non-White commodity farmers out there, and those who have been through a natural disaster in the last few years. For them, this situation is real and dire.

**But providing assistance to farmers in financial crisis is also the strategic thing to do.** 

We are at a critical turning point across agriculture, with historic risks, but also an historic opportunity. Farm financial crisis is at the center of our country’s current political and cultural divide, and how it is handled will either solidify that divide, or begin to bridge it. When you are with people in a crisis, they never forget it, and when you are not with people in a crisis, they never forget it.

How our country addresses this situation will have very significant impacts on a series of other critical issues, including the viability of rural communities, the costs of disruption of our food supply from climate and other events, the ability of families to enter farming and own and grow assets, whether the future of US agriculture will mitigate or amplify the inequality created by long-term discrimination and extraction, and on the foundations of our democracy.

This change in farmland ownership has significant and foundational implications to our democracy, and to the opportunity for self determination. As civil rights icon Charles Sherrod said, “All power comes from the land, and the land is from God.”  During the Civil Rights movement in Mississippi, Black-owned farmland, established by the Resettlement Administration during the New Deal, served as a place of safety for Freedom Riders and voter registration workers to stay and for people to gather. Farmers who owned land could speak up and show up without the fear of being fired from their job or thrown off of sharecropped land, as was too common for their neighbors. And the deeds of farmer-owned land were put up as bonds to release marchers and others from jail and keep the demonstrations alive. 

We have learned the lessons of the separation of farmers from ownership of their land in the histories of medieval feudalism and U.S. sharecropping. We know that story, and it does not end well for people or the land.

When I have spoken with people about this issue, and what we believe is coming, I have often been asked “How do you know?” It is the wrong question. 

The numbers in the 2022 Census of Agriculture tell the story.

* Knowledge of the importance of the use of cover crops and soil quality predates the time of Christ. Education about cover crops and soil quality has been a central focus of both government and academic institutions since the Dust Bowl, and billions of dollars in annual incentives have been provided through conservation and other programs. But in the 2022 Census of Agriculture, cover crops were established on less than 6% of all US cropland.  
* Despite significant federal spending that both increased assistance in federal programs for beginning farmers and provided funding for farmer training and transition programs, between 2017 and 2022, the average age of farmers continued to increase from 57.5 to 58.1.  
* The US has spent $135B on ad hoc safety net programs to address disaster, revenue and pandemic losses over the last 8 years, over and above an additional $130B in standing disaster, risk management and commodity programs, but the number of US farms fell by 141,733 between the 2017 and 2022 Census.  
* Despite increased assistance in a series of programs for socially-disadvantaged farmers, and significant funding of programs to provide outreach and training to socially disadvantaged producers, a far greater percentage of Black (8.1) and Native (3.4) farms in the US were lost between 2017 and 2022 than their White contemporaries (0.77).

These efforts are falling short because they are not addressing the systemic drivers. Farm loss and the restructuring of farmland ownership are the intended outcome of the industrialization economics frame that underpins US agricultural policy, prioritizing efficiency over all else. It is also the same headwind that efforts toward more independent, resilient, regenerative and democratic agriculture have always faced. The ever-increasing scale, mechanization, uniformity and concentration of industrial agriculture are underwritten and facilitated by the structure of farm safety net programs, and farmers in financial distress and those seeking change in agriculture are united in fighting the same forces. As a manifestation of this industrialization frame, the increasing cost of the farm safety net programs and the tens of billions of dollars spent by Congress on supplemental programs to address farm revenue and disaster losses reinforce this process, increasing future fragility, cost and farm loss.

Resilience is inefficient. The deal made with farmers starting post WWII and accelerating since the 1980s, is that if farmers chase industrial efficiency by eliminating inefficient, production-based resilience, then financial resilience will be provided by the taxpayer. The structure of the safety net intentionally provides an economic advantage for the most industrialized farms that rely most on government programs for resilience in adverse weather or market events, selecting for those who will be most susceptible to these disruptions and the most expensive to the taxpayer over time. A frequent statement by Sustainable Agriculture policy advocates is that 10% of farmers getting 80% of the payments is wrong and unfair. But through an efficiency lens, it is right and good for investment to go where it will, theoretically, have the greatest return, which is the largest scale and most mechanized farms. The concentration of payments, and the resulting economic advantages, are an intended outcome.

In this framework, any resilience provided within the production or marketing system, like conservation or crop rotation, becomes an economic disadvantage. For instance, if one farm invests in soil quality and another doesn’t, the first may have less severe weather losses, but when crop insurance or disaster programs make them even at the end of the year, the more resilient farm is at greater risk.  A farmer may increase their income by selling into higher-value specialty markets, but when, in an inevitable natural disaster, disaster assistance and crop insurance programs pay based on wholesale commodity prices, far less of their income is underwritten and they are far more likely to lose their farms.

The cost of propping up this fragile system is getting more and more expensive. We are spending more and more to drive land into the hands of fewer and fewer.

To be clear, ever-increasing efficiency requires farm loss. It is a feature, not a bug. And the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), used in 2018 and 2019 by the previous Trump administration to address revenue losses associated with their last trade war, and the model that the administration both used for 2024 revenue losses and has signaled they have waiting in the wings for 2025 losses, is a good example. 

The MFP provided a payment per acre set by USDA estimates of the market losses for each specific crop in 2018, or a per-acre loss average of the crops in a specific county in 2019\. The application was a simple list of the acres of each crop the farmer produced, and the payment calculation was elementary arithmetic. This model is simple, quick to administer, and easy to understand. However, it also guarantees that farmers keep losing farms and taxpayer costs keep rising into the foreseeable future.

Under a program like MFP, the biggest payments will go to the largest-scale farmers who are typically late in their careers, and whose economies of scale and asset size can limit losses on the front end and make them less vulnerable to losses on the back end.  The smallest payout will go to early-career farmers, farmers with smaller acreage or less collateral, who, along with farmers who have experienced a significant disaster in the last three to five years, are the most financially fragile. This magnifies the largest farms’ ability to out-compete smaller and newer entrants by upping rental prices, snapping up land from those needing liquidity, and just getting bigger. 

As the negative impacts of agricultural industrialization on farms, communities and the environment have become increasingly apparent, Congress has created separate conservation, nutrition, marketing, and other programs to address these issues, paying to re-introduce the systemic resilience that safety net programs have paid to eliminate. The taxpayer therefore pays handsomely to both create and address the issues. When weather and market risk are addressed primarily through safety net programs, conservation and marketing programs are not seen as key to farm viability and risk mitigation, but rather as “nice to have” supplements, and without the financial benefit of risk mitigation, any incentivization has to pay the full cost. And when the two are placed into competition, as was clear in the recent supplemental bill, long term resilience will always lose out to immediate farm survival. 

Advocates of sustainable, regenerative and equitable agriculture are united with family-scale commodity farmers facing losing their farms. They are fighting the same forces. And the safety net programs assure that both are losing.

**But it does not have to be this way.**

We can envision a true safety net that keeps farms in business no matter the scale or what is produced, encourages rather than discourages conservation, entrepreneurship and other enterprise resilience strategies, and does not facilitate increased concentration of assets and the re-establishment of feudalism. But achieving this vision will require partnership with family-scale commodity producers. Aggressive action to keep farmers on their land and in their homes in the short term is not only the moral choice. It is the best strategy toward an unlikely alliance that can result in fundamental change.

We are in a unique moment of clarity where the costs associated with the continued drive toward efficiency are evident across agriculture and politics. The repeated phrase used by Senators in a recent hearing was “This is not working.” Legislators from both sides of the aisle are wary of the massive spending of farmer payments, and the huge tradeoffs of what is not funded. There is an opportunity for unlikely partnerships, through the lens of farm financial viability and farmer ownership of land, that has a greater opportunity for systemic change than at any time since the 1980s.

But that process must start with decisive action and messaging to stop farm loss and show family-scale farmers that they are not alone. Conservation, entrepreneurship, and resilience must be integral parts of the farm loss solution, not compete with the farm loss solution for either funding or focus. And we must communicate effectively with those who have too often been political enemies.

**A Better Way**

A Better Way is a new initiative that will provide immediate resources for those farms in significant financial danger, connected to systemic policy change where increased resilience and autonomy are a fundamental strategy for farm viability into the future.

Under A Better Way, the response to farm financial crisis is grounded in a long-term commitment to and experience with keeping farm families on the land and in their homes, but is also:

* A critical opportunity to build clear alliance with farm families across scales of agriculture  
* A clear demonstration of the need for reform of the current system  
* A core frame of policy analysis and policy development  
* 

A Better Way responds to the immediate farm financial crisis while building the path to long term viability and resilience, with two integrated initiatives:

**No Farm Lost**; a comprehensive communications campaign to: 

* Disseminate critical information needed by farmers in financial crisis    
  * Focus broader attention on the critical societal and economic costs of farm loss and the transition to investment ownership of farmland, and  
  * Align future farm viability with the fundamental restructuring of farm programs  
  * Provide to agricultural organizations messaging for them to communicate effectively about this situation

And,

**Rethinking the Safety Net**; a process to develop a new vision for farm safety net programs that fulfills the three legs of the sustainability stool; 

* farm financial viability,   
* fiscal responsibility to the taxpayer, and   
* care for people, land, and the environment.

And a plan for the outreach, advocacy and unlikely partnerships needed for the plan to come to fruition.

Resulting in;

* An overall vision for a fundamental change to the structure of US farm policy  
* Specific policy initiatives at legislative and administrative levels to advance this vision  
* Ongoing analysis and communications regarding emerging agricultural policy and the farm economy  
* Strategic organizing and advocacy toward the implementation of the new safety bet framework.

 

**No Farm Lost**

Farm loss is a critical point of intervention to mitigate the extreme human and financial cost, analyze the failing edges of current farm policy, and build coalition across political divides. It is one of few leverage points where farmers are searching for and open to significant changes in their farming operations. It is also the clearest indication of the integrity or lack of integrity of a commitment to farm viability. 

No Farm Lost will be grounded in immediately accessible, farmer friendly information and guidance to farmers in imminent danger of farm loss, delivered through a specifically focused web-accessible resources hub. No Farm Lost will provide connection to technical assistance, but will be focused on information for farmers, farm families and those assisting them who are forced to navigate this situation on their own. We will also provide materials or training to existing farmer-facing organizations and companies to leverage their direct farmer contact in information delivery and to message clearly about the importance of farmer ownership of land. We will develop farmer-accessible materials and training focused on working with farmers in financial crisis, and make these materials available to as broad a range of organizations as possible, including lenders, Cooperative Extension, crop consultants, commodity groups and national farm organizations.

No Farm Lost will also provide clear and urgent information about the dangers and impacts of the farm loss situation we now face. We will disseminate data and analysis from existing sources on the numbers and types of farms in financial danger, the transition of farmland to investment vehicles, and clarify the fundamental societal impacts of both. We will make clear through our communications that we are now at a tipping point where the concept of farmer ownership of land and the Jeffersonian ideal is giving way to the reestablishment of feudalism, with a critical mass of farmland owned as investment vehicles. We will aggressively clarify that this is a time of choosing between belief and support for farmer ownership of land or its effective end, and we will push organizations and leaders to make their choice clear.

The current moment is making clear that the current safety net is working only for the bankers and big corporations. Farmers of all scales are facing significant challenges to their ability to continue farming and to pass that farm on to the next generation, rural towns are facing collapse from loss of population and economic activity, and the increasingly severe and frequent weather events associated with climate change are overwhelming all programs and capacity to respond to them. While many across agriculture will agree that the system is not working, their perception of the causes and solutions are often at odds. But basic farm survival is the only core issue that can unite across many of the current political divisions.

No farm Lost will be a lifeline to struggling farm families to let them know that they are not alone.

**Rethinking the Safety Net**

Rethinking the Safety Net will bring together innovative farm policy leaders in an iterative process that leverages long term policy experience and innovation to develop new policy models for the farm safety net that address farmer concerns and fears about short and long-term financial viability, the significant rising cost to the taxpayer of providing the agricultural safety net to industrialized agriculture and incentivizes the reintegration of resilient agricultural production at a wide range of scales. 

This safety net, organized across the varying areas of USDA, will balance efficiency with resilience, based on the following principles: 

1. Safety net programs will be provided with equivalent and appropriate benefits regardless of scale, crop or market.   
2. The safety net will encourage and recognize multilevel resilience strategies that reduce risk, established by research and farmer experience, to mitigate climate and market impacts. Where actuarial data is not sufficient or available to fully quantify the risk mitigation benefits, pilot programs will be used to develop that data.  
3. The safety net will recognize the critical resilience benefits of diversification and decentralization across agriculture, including scale, production, crop and farmer diversity   
4. The safety net will support and encourage farmer innovation and entrepreneurship to create the most resilient and financially rewarding enterprise possible at that farm’s scale, environment, and farmer capacity rather than requiring increased scale and further concentration of assets.   
5. The safety net will balance rather than amplify the market drive towards highly concentrated, highly fragile and undemocratic agricultural production and marketing systems.   
6. The safety net will limit the financial cost to the taxpayer, and assure that these programs are, in fact, a true safety net and not a profit center.

This process will start with a small working group with members representing high-level policy experience from the government, research and direct service sectors to collaborate on: 

* Analysis of the current and emerging agricultural policy structure,   
* The development of innovative policy models that take a systemic view of agricultural risk,   
* Identify and address gaps in needed data or research, and   
* Map out short- and long-term strategy to maximize the opportunity for adoption including a plan for strategic communications and engagement of potential allies or opposition driven by political strategy. 

This process will take place confidentially, with any public communication driven by implementation strategy. Written materials or public information dissemination will be dictated by the end goal of fundamental policy change. 

The core team will meet in a series of quarterly retreats. 

* The group will start the process with development of policy criteria that can be used to evaluate proposed policies, but also evaluate policy developments happening in either legislation or administration.   
* Retreats will follow an iterative process, similar to the scientific method, of the development of proposed models as hypotheses, testing between sessions through analysis, research or casework, re-evaluation of the models with new information based on the established criteria, and then refinement or revision of the initial hypothesis to be tested before the next session.  
* Between sessions, members of the group will meet as needed in teams working on specific aspects of the policy development process.  
* Policy development will be integrated with analysis of the political environment and pathways to successful reform. This includes potential allies and opposition, budgetary considerations, effective messaging and opportunities for intermediate steps.

We are exploring housing Rethinking the Safety Net in a university, think tank, or broad-based advocacy forum setting, combining the best of direct service, policy and research expertise, and providing opportunities for students to participate in the process and develop both expertise and skills to be able to engage in agricultural policy over the length of their careers.  

Communications

The public-facing communications of this initiative will combine farmer story-telling with background analysis, with an overarching narrative that directly connects farmer experience with both systemic analysis and proposed solutions. Over 2-3 years, communications will walk through the logic chain that undergirds the proposed policy changes.

* Phase 1: Specific focus on farm financial issues and the importance of farmer ownership of land, reflecting and addressing farmer experience. During this phase we will build engagement and communication infrastructure and establish unlikely partnerships. While driving issues like climate resilience, economic development, program costs will be included, they will be secondary to farmer experience with financial crisis.  
  * No Farm Lost web resources  
  * Brief, home-made farmer-to-farmer videos, with farmers who have been through financial crises speaking directly to those who are going through it now with words of encouragement and advice.  
  * Brief op-eds and articles aimed at farm and popular media focusing on the importance of farmer ownership of land.  
  * Communications tool kit for agriculture focused, or agriculture adjacent organizations on how to understand and communicate about farmer crises within their organizational mission.  
  * Join Us sign-on campaign calling for public commitment to farmer ownership of land as a values statement.  
* Phase 2: Use of farmer stories, backed up by policy and economic analysis, to establish underlying drivers of the current situation and the need for significant, structural reform, grounded in farmer experience and program costs.  
  * Farmer stories reflecting their experience with the drivers of farm financial crisis through video and written documents, connected directly to experience with financial crisis.  
  * White papers on the specific drivers of farm financial crisis, including climate, corporate concentration, and the underlying prioritization of efficiency, tied to farmer stories.  
  * Online campaign to sharpen focus on farmer ownership of land, and push organizations / agencies to be public in their support for farmer ownership.  
* Phase 3: Release of and advocacy for policy reforms, through diverse channels, to target both farmers and policymakers. The goal is for policy proposals to come from a series of diverse sources, providing the compelling story, the background analysis and the budget implications.  
  * Policy analysis white papers from academic, policy think tank and other sources.  
  * Farmer leadership statements on the need for the proposed policy recommendations.   
  * Public event for the release of the policy platform with farmer stories, backed by analysis

The timing of these phases will be driven by the timing of events and development of materials. 

By narrowly focusing initial communications on farmer experience and financial crisis, we build: 

* A foundation of clear, shared commitment to farm financial viability across farmer categories,    
* Time to develop unlikely partnerships or alliances based on that shared commitment,   
* Time to communicate and disseminate policy proposals in strategic ways, with control of the message and the medium of dissemination well into the process. 

Any innovative policy proposal will face opposition from both friends and enemies, either because it goes too far or does not go far enough, and what it does or does not do. Without the step by step logic, any sufficiently bold policy proposal will be met by “sticker shock.” This plan builds in the quiet process of confidential vetting with a widening circle of both potential partners and adversaries, building unlikely but strategic partnerships.

Scott Marlow, Long Rows Consulting, and former Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs and Senior Advisor to the Administrator, USDA Farm Service Agency

Scott Marlow brings to policy development over 25 years at the front lines of farm and rural viability, sustainability and resilience, connecting direct service “kitchen table” experience with national policy through grassroots engagement, coalition building, and systems analysis. As a Biden/Harris Administration appointed he led the USDA Farm Services Agency and oversaw more than $20B in assistance to farmers, including disaster, commodity, conservation and credit programs. His tenure at USDA included two high-priority responses to farming disasters and the development and implementation of financial crisis assistance initiatives resulting in groundbreaking programs that enabled thousands of farmers to remain on their land and in their homes. Prior to USDA, Scott spent 27 years in the non-profit world, with 10 years as an operator on farm crisis hotlines, and 15 years training individuals and organizations on working with farmers in financial crisis and natural disasters. Scott has developed training, analysis and successful policy initiatives on farm and rural disaster recovery, credit, risk management and commodity programs. He specializes in large scale, systems level analysis of how, in a changing climate, farm safety net and credit programs determine who gets to farm, what they get to farm, and how.
